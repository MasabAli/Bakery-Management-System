# Bakery-Management-System
The main goal of a computerized bakery management system is to make the workflow flexible and to improve the services provided to the customers. The bakery shop provides desired food items to the customerâ€™s i.e. simple cake and ice cake. We are concerned about delivering on time for customer satisfaction. The first and foremost module is receiving the order from the customer. All details of the customer and his order along with his specifications are received and saved. Price varies according to the product. The implementation of this system will completely change the existing norm of people working in a bakery. So this system is more comfortable than the traditional management systems, and also the timeliness and punctuality keep a business successful.
